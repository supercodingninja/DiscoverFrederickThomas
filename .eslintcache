The constant git version control difficulties my group had (most due to a lack of organization) strengthen me; and shown me who I want to be as a developer: write clean code, as simple as possible (for others to quickly understand, especially those behind you), utilize the proper languages and tools suitable for client, team, and individual success, find people who do not underestimate the value of effective communication and simplicity; and most importantly, someone who has your back, no matter what the situation is: I want my character to speak for me.
